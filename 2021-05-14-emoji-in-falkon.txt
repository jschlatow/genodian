Once in a while, I come across a website that uses unicode emoji for
illustration. Github is one of these that uses such symbols in the sidebar of
the [https://github.com/notifications - notification view]. However, if you do
not have a font installed that contains the corresponding glyphs, you will only
see those beautiful inexpressive boxes âŒ· (or even whitespace). This is the case
for the falkon browser packaged for Sculpt. Yet, it is pretty easy to augment it
with emoji support.

By default, the falkon browser is packaged with DejaVu Sans (provided by
'raw/qt5_dejavusans'), which only contains very few emoji glyphs. To enjoy a
fully-fledged browsing experience with Sculpt, it must be supplied with an
emoji-capable font, either as the default font, or as a fallback font. This is
done in nine easy steps. By the way, this trick is also applicable to other qt5
apps, e.g. qt5_textedit.

As a prequisite, you need a running virtual machine or another system with zip
and tar capabilities.

In a *first* step, you download the latest 'raw/qt5_dejavusans' e.g. from
[https://depot.genode.org/cproc/raw/qt5_dejavusans/ - cproc's depot] and untar
the archive after verifying the signature. Note, that '{yyyy-mm-dd}'
is a placeholder for the current version:

! gpg --verify {yyyy-mm-dd}.tar.xz.sig
! tar xvf {yyyy-mm-dd}.tar.xz
! cd {yyyy-mm-dd}/
! tar xvf {qt5_dejavusans.tar}

This will create 'qt/lib/fonts/DejaVuSans.ttf'.

*Second*, download an emoji capable font (e.g. Google Noto) and put the ttf
file into 'qt/lib/fonts/'. This folder should now contains DejaVuSans.ttf (the
default font) and you downloaded ttf as a fallback font.

*Third*, create a new tarball 'qt5_dejavusans.tar' from the entire 'qt/' folder
and make it available to your Sculpt system. If you are working in a virtual
machine, place it in the shared folder. Otherwise, copy it to a USB stick.

! tar cavf /mnt/shared/qt5_dejavusans.tar qt/

*Fourth*, in your Sculpt system, you must deploy the default falkon package,
which is available in cproc's depot. (If you are already using falkon, you can
skip this step.)

! +
!  -> Depot
!     -> cproc
!       -> Tools
!         -> falkon

*Fifth*, you create a local copy of 'pkg/falkon' and 'raw/qt5_dejavusans' in the
used file system:

! cd /usb-1-4.3/  # put in the name of the used file system
! mkdir -p depot/local/pkg
! mkdir -p depot/local/raw
! cp -r depot/cproc/pkg/falkon depot/local/pkg/
! cp -r depot/cproc/raw/qt5_dejavusans depot/local/raw/

*Sixth*, copy the 'qt5_dejavusans.tar' from above into
'depot/local/raw/qt5_dejavusans/{yyyy-mm-dd}/.

*Seventh*, edit 'depot/local/pkg/falkon/{yyyy-mm-dd}/archives' and change
'cproc/raw/qt5_dejavusans/{yyyy-mm-dd}' into
'local/raw/qt5_dejavusans/{yyyy-mm-dd}'.

*Eighth*, create an index file for your local depot and the current Sculpt
version (e.g. 'depot/local/index/21.03') with the following content:

!<index>
!
!  <index name="Tools">
!    <pkg path="local/pkg/falkon/{yyyy-mm-dd}" info="Falkon Browser with Emoji"/>
!  </index>
!
!</index>

*Ninth and last*, startup the falkon pkg from your local depot and open a test
page with emoji (e.g. this article).
