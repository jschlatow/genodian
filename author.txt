Johannes got in contact with Genode in 2014 when he was working as a real-time
systems researcher at TU Braunschweig.  At that time, Genode inspired his own
research and was applied in the DFG-funded research unit "Controlling Concurrent
Change" for building demonstrators of dynamically managing critical embedded
systems. With an ever growing enthusiasm towards the framework he became a
full-time Genode developer in 2021.
